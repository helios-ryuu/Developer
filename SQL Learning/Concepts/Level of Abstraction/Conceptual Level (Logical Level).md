This level describes what data is stored in the database and the relationships among those data. It focuses on the logical structure and relationships of the data without concern for how it is physically stored. It involves:
- **Data Types**: Defining the various types of data that need to be stored (e.g., integers, strings, dates).
- **Relationships**: Establishing the relationships between different data entities (e.g., customers and orders).
- **Schema Design**: Creating a logical schema that represents the entire database structure without considering how data will be stored physically.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring that data relationships and constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys) are maintained.
- **DBMS Independence**: This level abstracts the physical details from the users and application programmers.
