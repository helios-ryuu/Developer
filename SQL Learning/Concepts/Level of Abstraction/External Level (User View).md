This is the highest level of abstraction and is concerned with how the data is viewed by individual users or specific application programs. It focuses on how users and applications interact with the database, providing customized views and access controls. It involves:
- **User Interfaces**: Providing different views of the database for different users or user groups.
- **Customized Views**: Allowing users to see only the data they are interested in and hide the rest.
- **Application Programs**: Supporting the specific requirements of various applications by providing appropriate views.
- **Access Control**: Implementing security measures to ensure that users can only access the data they are authorized to see.
