# **SQL**
**SQL** is a ==standardized programming language== used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is used for querying, updating, and managing data. Key SQL operations include:
- **SELECT**: Retrieve data from a database.
- **INSERT**: Add new records to a database.
- **UPDATE**: Modify existing records.
- **DELETE**: Remove records.
- **CREATE**: Create new database objects like tables and indexes.
- **DROP**: Delete database objects.
# SQL Server
**SQL Server** is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. It uses SQL to interact with the data stored within its databases. SQL Server provides a range of services, including:
- **Database Engine**: Core service for data storage, processing, and security.
- **SQL Server Agent**: Schedules jobs and manages tasks.
- **SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)**: For creating and managing reports.
- **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)**: For data integration and workflow applications.
- **SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)**: For online analytical processing (OLAP) and data mining.
# Query
A **query** is a request for data or information from a database. Queries are written in SQL for relational databases. A query can perform various operations like:
- Retrieving specific data (e.g., SELECT).
- Filtering data based on conditions.
- Updating or deleting data.
- Performing calculations and aggregations.
# NoSQL
**NoSQL** refers to a category of database management systems that do not adhere to the traditional relational database model. NoSQL databases are designed for specific data models and have flexible schemas. They are particularly useful for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Types of NoSQL databases include:
- **Document Stores**: Store data as documents (e.g., JSON, BSON) (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB).
- **Key-Value Stores**: Store data as key-value pairs (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB).
- **Wide-Column Stores**: Use tables, rows, and dynamic columns (e.g., Cassandra, HBase).
- **Graph Databases**: Store data in graph structures with nodes and edges (e.g., Neo4j, OrientDB).
