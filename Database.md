# Database
A **database** is an ==organized collection of data== that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are used to store information in a ==structured format==, allowing for efficient retrieval and manipulation of data. Databases can be:
- **Relational Databases**: Store data in tables with rows and columns (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL).
- **NoSQL Databases**: Store data in formats other than tables, such as document, key-value, wide-column, and graph formats (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
# Relational Database
A **relational database** is a type of database that organizes data into tables, which can be linked—or related—based on data common to each. Key features include:
- **Tables**: Consist of rows and columns.
- **Primary Keys**: Unique identifiers for records in a table.
- **Foreign Keys**: References to primary keys in other tables, establishing relationships.
- **Normalization**: Process of structuring data to minimize redundancy.
Examples of relational databases include SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle Database.
