This is the lowest level of abstraction<sup>trừu tượng</sup> and deals with how the data is physically stored in the database. It focuses on the technical details of data storage, indexing, and access methods. It involves:
- **Storage Management**: Determining how data will be stored on the physical medium (e.g., hard drives, SSDs).
- **Data Structures**: Choosing the right data structures (e.g., B-trees, hash tables) for efficient storage and retrieval.
- **Indexing**: Deciding on the types of indexes needed to speed up data retrieval.
- **Access Methods**: Choosing between sequential access or random access based on how the data will be used.
- **File Organization**: Organizing data into files and determining the placement of these files.
- **DBMS Administration**: This level is primarily the concern of database administrators (DBAs) who manage the technical aspects of storage.
